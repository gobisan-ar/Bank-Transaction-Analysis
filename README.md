  ### Project Desctiption:
  
  <p style="text-align:justify;">
    Developed an ETL process using SSIS to extract data from multiple sources, transform it, and load it into the data warehouse. The data warehouse is based on a snowflake       schema, which contains an Accumalting Fact table, a SCD and other dimensions. An SSAS cube was created using the data warehoue as data source. An Excel workbook was           connected to the Cube to create Excel visulaizations. In addition SSRS visualizations also created.
